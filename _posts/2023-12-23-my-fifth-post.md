## Description

# What happened?

There was a seminar for us on the fifth of December of 2023 by Babak Reihani and his team explaining the concept of IoT and the devices, connections, and platforms used in it followed by videos of examples of it.
This professional team has practical experiences and came to our university to introduce us to the vast world of IOT and its benefits and answer our curiosity.

## Feelings

# What were your thoughts and feelings?

It's such an honor to meet great people in the IT industry and I'm thankful for the opportunities that our university and teachers bring to us to know different fields of IT and companies working on them. I think it helps us to choose our future career more wisely.

## Evaluation

# What was good or bad about this experience?

As I mentioned before it's very good that we can meet professionals in different fields of IT. We can know each field, compare them, and choose the career we want.
Also, the PowerPoint used in this seminar was edited very nicely. The order of topics was smooth and relevant and the design of it was not boring at all. Another thing that I liked was the use of videos to show examples of IOT in our lives. I think it was a very wise choice for Gen Z students who get bored and distracted easily.

## Analysis

# What sense can you make of what happened?

It was a generic seminar without going so much into detail but it covered many important aspects of IOT such as its history, devices and connections used in it, IOT platform, smart cities, and examples of using IOT.

## Conclusion

# What else could they have done?

After the seminar, many students were searching for their contact details, if they have courses or internships available, or their address. I think they should mention this information in their seminar.
