## Collaborative Discussion1

A “(fully) digital enterprise” is never explicitly defined in the article, but it can be defined as an organization that holistically employs technology to improve every aspect of its operations. This is not digitization that is limited to an IT department, but digitization that encompasses how every member or employee operates in some fashion. The idea of a fully digital enterprise is enticing as it allows for unmatched efficiency, automation, and scalability. However, this level of digitization also comes with a significant amount of risk.
An essential aspect of a fully digital enterprise that is not readily apparent is the management of both homogenous and disparate systems. Who, or what, is managing the systems, and how are they being managed? According to Johnson Service Group, a long-standing North American staffing agency, approximately 63% of companies have IT departments that are understaffed (Bennett, 2021). An acceptable option to manage these systems is via some bespoke aggregate tool, pulling every system into a centralized control center and perhaps utilizing software such as Prometheus and Ansible. Unfortunately, this option has the side effect of adding more responsibilities and required development time to the already understaffed and overworked IT department. Another, and often ideal option, is to outsource the management, usually via paid support tiers. A couple of examples are Crowdstrike’s “Overwatch” or Arctic Wolf’s “Concierge Security Team”; both teams are outsourced and highly specialized, and they will actively monitor and triage issues in your environment, for a price.
A more classic small to medium enterprise that is looking to expand into digitalization faces a number of challenges, both from a human perspective and from a technical perspective. Obvious technical challenges include the setup and maintenance of systems and networks, which are becoming increasingly specialized as technologies such as hyper-converged infrastructure become more popular and readily accessible. Probably the most important human challenge would be the mandated and quality education and training of the existing IT department which, again, would be adding more stress and responsibilities to what is most likely an already understaffed and overworked group of people.
The article “Digital Innovation: Creating the Utility of the Future” by Wei et al. (2019), describes a utopian utility company of the future. While I do agree that utilities are, of course, expanding into renewable sources of energy and becoming more digital, the article does suggest idealism, even at the time. Given the ongoing energy crisis that began in 2021, a year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several nations have been forced to do such things as restart coal plants. Food, water, fuel, electricity, and many other commodities are rising dramatically in price. The energy crisis cannot be directly attributed, but the economic rebound shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was a contributing factor, as is the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In particular, the severe geopolitical consequences that followed Russia’s invasion. The reliance on Russia for oil, gas, and coal by several nations particularly in Europe, (which previously included the UK), is substantial. A favorable result is a potential for a rapid shift from traditional fuel sources such as coal, natural gas, and crude, to much cleaner and more efficient sources such as nuclear, wind, and solar, especially as the costs associated with wind and solar are swiftly reducing.
