## IoT Infrastructure

# What would be a typical IoT infrastructure setup for our greenhouses?

There are several types of monitoring equipment available to greenhouse operators. These include sensors that measure the temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse, a general platform that sends a signal to a fan controller, and temperature and humidity monitors that are built into the greenhouse itself. The latter is often more convenient for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it allows the operator to limit the retractable roof and close vents when the environment is too warm or too cold. Some sensors can be hardwired to your greenhouse, but this can be costly and logistically difficult. Other sensors can be wireless and communicate with the base unit via a radio transmitter. Many monitoring and control systems will accommodate both types of sensors. These systems also allow you to monitor multiple areas at one time. A combination of hardwire and wireless sensors can be very effective, enabling you to monitor your entire greenhouse system.

•	CARBON DIOXIDE SENSORS

One of the most common methods of greenhouse monitoring is through the use of carbon dioxide sensors. These devices monitor the CO2 level in the greenhouse and transmit sensor data to control systems. The technology used to measure the CO2 levels in the greenhouse is also known as infrared thermometers. These CO2 monitors have several advantages, such as providing real-time data that allows growers to make changes to the environment on the spot based on the data collected.

•	SOIL MOISTURE SENSORS

A soil moisture sensor can measure the dielectric constant of soil. The capacitance of a leaf is proportional to its volumetric water content. As a rule, soil moisture sensor uses capacitance technology to measure moisture levels, which is one of the crucial agricultural parameters. The high frequency of this technology of soil monitoring eliminates “noise” and offers high-resolution measurements. The wireless monitoring and control sensors are ideal for monitoring the greenhouse environment and are compatible with both wired and wireless Ethernet connections.

•	TEMPERATURE SENSORS

Temperature sensors are one of the most widely used in greenhouse monitoring and control since without proper temperature levels it is impossible to create conditions favorable for the agricultural land. Temperature sensors can be paired with an environmental monitoring platform that stores all the collected raw data. The system is designed to integrate the data from all the sensors and provide managers with real-time access to it, so it will be possible to transmit data if necessary and send control signals. Whether the sensor is a temperature-controlled device or a wireless model, this system is an essential part of the greenhouse management process and makes a great contribution to the global IoT in the agriculture market, in general.

•	WATER SENSORS

The most common type of greenhouse water sensor is a rain gauge. This sensor is usually installed outside the greenhouse. It measures rainfall. This type of sensor is best for monitoring greenhouses, as it can respond quickly to changes in climate and provides a profound data analysis. The rain gauge is a simple and effective solution for measuring the moisture in the soil. In addition to its effectiveness in monitoring the greenhouse’s environment, it can also help you manage water more efficiently. Based on such sensor readings you may set the automation system of water irrigation.

•	LIGHT SENSORS

The use of structured light sensors in agriculture has many applications. These sophisticated devices monitor the amount of sunlight a crop is receiving. This information is used to make important farming decisions. It can help understand the impact of different lighting conditions on plant development. It can also be useful to monitor and analyze crop yield. This technology allows farmers to detect whether a specific crop needs more water than another one. It also improves general agricultural processes.
The application of light sensors in agriculture is a great way to improve the yield of a crop. This technology helps farmers predict when the right amount of water and nutrients should be applied. In addition, a light sensor can help farmers predict how much nitrogen fertilizer they need to apply to the soil to promote optimal plant development.
The use of optical sensors in agriculture can help farmers improve soil and crop quality. There are three main types of optical sensors used in agriculture. They monitor canopy spectral reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and the amount of nitrogen absorbed by plants. This information helps farmers make the necessary adjustments to their crops. This technology is also used to assess the pH and nutrient content of the soil. If the sensor can detect the amount of chlorophyll, it can also detect the presence of specific ions in the soil, making it useful for agricultural scientists.

•	HUMIDITY SENSORS

In the greenhouse environment, a humidity sensor is a necessity. The most widely used humidity sensor is a hygrometer. A hygrometer is a device that measures the humidity of the air in a greenhouse. It can also monitor pressure and air quality. When this sensor is powered with artificial intelligence and can not only transmit collected data to the proposed system storage but also interpret sensor readings, it can enormously contribute to the automation of remote control applications and machine learning.

•	3-IN-1 SENSORS

With the development of the environment monitoring sphere, has emerged a separate section of universal sensors, that can track air quality, soil moisture, and water distribution at once with low energy consumption. A multi-sensor monitoring kit can also monitor light and pH. Such 3-in-one sensors are comfortable to use as they can cover all the monitoring and control needs in agriculture.
In greenhouse environment monitoring, it is possible to apply quite a wide range of sensors. The main thing here is that sensors have to support wireless communication technology, provide uninterrupted data flow, and have a simple user interface. IoT sensors for agriculture are versatile and that is why you can find the one perfectly suitable for your environmental monitoring needs.

## Constraints

# What are some constraints we may be dealing with within our greenhouse operation?

Running an Internet of Things (IoT) greenhouse operation involves managing various challenges and constraints. Here are some common constraints associated with typical IoT greenhouse operations:

•	LIMITED CONNECTIVITY

Greenhouses may be located in remote areas with limited access to stable internet connections. This can hinder real-time monitoring and control of IoT devices.

•	POWER CONSTRAINTS

Some greenhouse locations may have limited access to a reliable power supply. IoT devices need a constant power source, and managing power consumption becomes crucial in such scenarios.

•	DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY

IoT devices generate a significant amount of data, including environmental and crop information. Ensuring the security and privacy of this data is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse.

•	COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

Greenhouses often use a variety of equipment and sensors from different manufacturers. Ensuring interoperability and compatibility among these devices can be a challenge.

•	ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

Greenhouses are subjected to varying environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to sunlight. IoT devices need to be robust enough to withstand these conditions without compromising functionality.

•	COST CONSTRAINTS

Implementing and maintaining an IoT infrastructure in a greenhouse can be expensive. Small-scale or traditional greenhouse operators may face challenges in adopting and affording the necessary technology.

•	SCALABILITY

As the size of the greenhouse operation grows, scalability becomes a concern. Ensuring that the IoT system can scale to accommodate an expanding facility is essential for long-term success.

•	SKILL GAPS

The effective deployment and management of IoT systems require specific technical skills. Greenhouse operators may face challenges in finding personnel with the necessary expertise to implement and maintain these technologies.
