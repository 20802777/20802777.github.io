During scanning activities, we tried ethical hacking and exploring the networks with the Kali Linux application. We learned many commands like ‘traceroute’ as a network diagnostic tool to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from source to destination, ‘ifconfig’ to view active network interface settings, or ‘ping’ to determine latency and packet loss. We also learned tools like PentBox to allow us to create honeypots in our system. Also, our teacher introduced us to many opportunities that Kali Linux can bring to us as ethical hackers, like information gathering apps, vulnerability analysis apps, and other kinds of applications available in Kali Linux.

One of my challenges during these activities was the old-fashioned and confusing interface of Kali Linux. The process of installation was even more confusing. But we overcame this problem with the help of our teacher and his presence from the installation process till the end.
