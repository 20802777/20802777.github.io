During scanning activities, we tried ethical hacking and exploring the networks with the Kali Linux application. We learned many commands like ‘traceroute’ as a network diagnostic tool to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet on an IP network from source to destination, ‘ifconfig’ to view active network interface settings, or ‘ping’ to determine latency and packet loss. We also learned tools like PentBox to allow us to create honeypots in our system. Also, our teacher introduced us to many opportunities that Kali Linux can bring to us as ethical hackers, like information gathering apps, vulnerability analysis apps, and other kinds of applications available in Kali Linux.

One of my challenges during these activities was the old-fashioned and confusing interface of Kali Linux. The process of installation was even more confusing. But we overcame this problem with the help of our teacher and his presence from the installation process till the end.

Another challenge for me was the forgettable nature of this activity. I would learn everything in the class but after some days, when I wanted to explore in the house, I couldn’t. So reporting our activities was a little hard for me at the end. I wish we could record all the things that we did during scanning. Luckily, we had access to links to websites explaining scanning tools and commands in our lecture notes and some of the tools and commands that we used in our activity were in those lecture notes too.

Also, we faced some problems with the website mentioned in the lecture note (daedalus-systems.co.uk) and commands like traceroute because of restrictions installed on university laboratory computers so we used google.com instead or pinged with emu.edu.tr.

Lastly, when I tried commands on my personal computer at home, the result that I got was very different from the results that I got in university. So understanding the nature of the commands and what is exactly happening behind the screen helped me to not get confused and understand why I get different results or I can’t access a piece of special information.

In conclusion, it was an exciting hands-on experience to understand cybersecurity and its tools better and we learned far more than just lecture notes. I hope I’ll have the chance to learn more about Kali Linux and the different applications embedded in it but this time I’ll make sure to record everything properly.
