## How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?
There are 12 distinct Hops between the starting address and the final website.
## Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?
A. The Biggest Delay in the route is 28.588ms (adm-b10-link.ip.twelve99.net)
B. From our Traceroute at this step we had the following for 2 packets recorded 28.588 and 26.916 for
this link giving an average of
(26.916 + 28.588) / 2 = 27.752
However, if we wanted a fair result, we would have to repeat the test a number of times to know if this was
the lowest performance or if this result was due to traffic or some other network condition at the time we
ran the original traceroute command.
## What are the main nameservers for the website?
