### Identify how an IoT solution might be used to help the company address each objective listed below.

## Increase customer loyalty

Implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technology in elevators can substantially elevate the customer experience, leading to increased loyalty. By incorporating IoT sensors on critical components, elevators can undergo predictive maintenance, anticipating potential issues and minimizing downtime. Remote monitoring and diagnostics enable swift responses to problems, ensuring operational reliability. The optimization of energy usage through IoT contributes to both cost savings and aligns with sustainability goals, appealing to environmentally conscious customers. Personalized user experiences, facilitated by smart features like predictive call buttons, enhance user satisfaction. Furthermore, the implementation of touchless controls and intuitive interfaces fosters a modern and convenient experience. Safety features, driven by IoT sensors, contribute to a secure environment, building trust with users.

## Improve service maintenance and predictive maintenance

Poor installation and maintenance are some of the major causes of elevator accidents. Traditional methods of condition monitoring may not be able to detect early indications of possible issues, thus making maintenance less effective. IoT technology provides fault diagnosis with real-time condition monitoring data and sends alerts to the concerned teams. They can quickly take action to fix the issue or the faulty component. This lowers the possibility of accidents or injuries, making the elevators & escalators safe and efficient.

## Manage spare parts inventory more efficiently
